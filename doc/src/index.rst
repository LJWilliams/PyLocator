PyLocator
=====================================================================
Localization of EEG-electrodes from MRI-volumes
-----------------------------------------------

PyLocator is an application for localizing EEG electrodes from MR-images.
It uses VTK to show a neat GUI for marking electrode locations in 3d-space.

It is based on previous work by John D. Hunter and Michael Castell as
part of `pbrain <https://github.com/nipy/pbrain>`_, now maintained by Eli
Albert. PyLocator works as a stand-alone program without any dependencies
from pbrain.
